     <h1>What is XML?</h1>

     <ul>
        <li>XML stands for EXtensible Markup Language</li>
        <li>XML is a markup language much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to describe data</li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must define your own tags</li>
        <li>XML uses a Document Type Definition (DID) or an XML  Schema to the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be self-descriptive</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>
    XML  was designed to carry data.<br/><br/>
     
    XML is not a replacement for HTML.<br/>
    XML and HTML were designed with different goals:<br/><br/>

    XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is.<br/>
    HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.<br/><br/><br/>


    HTML is obout displaying information. while XML is about describing information<br/>
    <h1>XML does not DO anything</h1>
    <strong>XML was not designed to DO anything</strong>

    Maybe it is a little hard to understand, but XML does not DO anything. XML was created to structure. store and to send information.<br/><br/>
    The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:<br/><br/>
    <textarea rows="6" cols="80" ><note></note></textarea>
    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and receiver information. But still. this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped in XML  tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</p>
